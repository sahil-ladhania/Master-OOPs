        /*
            Objective - Develop an area calculator for different shapes using polymorphism and inheritance.
            Details :
                1.	Classes -
                        Shape: An abstract class with an abstract method calculateArea().
                        Circle, Rectangle, Triangle: Extend the Shape class and implement the calculateArea() method.
                2.	Inheritance -
                        Use inheritance to derive specific shapes from the Shape class.
                3.	Polymorphism -
                        Create a method that accepts a Shape reference and calculates the area for any shape.
                4.	Encapsulation -
                        Use private attributes for shape dimensions and provide public methods to access them.
                5.	Implementation -
                        Create a main method to create shape objects and calculate their areas.
