            	1.	Student Class with Non-Parameterized Constructor and this Keyword
                    - Create a Student class with attributes name and age.
                    - Implement a non-parameterized constructor that initializes the name and age to default values using
                      "this" keyword to refer to instance variables.

	            2.	Animal Class with Default Values
                    - Write a class Animal where the default constructor sets the attributes type and sound to default values.
                    - Use "this" keyword to refer to the current instance.

                3.	House Class: Demonstrating Default Constructor
                    - Create a House class with a default constructor that prints “House created”.
                    - Use this to refer to the current instance if needed (e.g., within a method).

                4.	Bike Class with Default Constructor and Default Values
                    - Define a Bike class with attributes brand and speed.
                    - The non-parameterized constructor should assign default values for these attributes and print them.
                    - Use this to reference instance variables.

                5.	Pen Class with Default Constructor
                    - Create a Pen class with a non-parameterized constructor that assigns default values to the attributes color and type.
                    - Use "this" keyword inside the constructor to refer to the instance variables.
