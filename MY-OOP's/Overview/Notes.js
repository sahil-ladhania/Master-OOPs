1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Answer :
* OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).


2. How is Object-Oriented Programming Related to the Real World?
Answer :
* Real-World Mapping - OOP models real-world entities as objects. For example, a car can be an object with attributes like color, model, and speed, and methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate().
* Interaction - Just as real-world objects interact with each other, objects in OOP interact through methods and messaging.


3. Why Study OOP?
Answer :
* Modularity - Makes code easier to manage and understand. Large projects are divided into smaller, manageable objects.
* Reusability - Objects and classes can be reused across programs.
* Extensibility - Easily extend the functionality of code via inheritance and polymorphism.
* Maintainability - Easier to update and maintain code due to clear structure and modularity.


4. What are the Limitations of OOP?
Answer :
* Complexity - Can be more complex than procedural programming, especially for small programs.
* Performance - Sometimes less efficient in terms of speed and memory compared to procedural programming.
* Learning Curve - Steeper learning curve for beginners.
* Overhead - May introduce unnecessary overhead if not used properly.


5. What Does it Mean When We Say a Language is Object-Oriented?
Answer :
* Classes and Objects - The language supports the creation of classes and objects.
* Encapsulation - The language supports encapsulation, ensuring that data is hidden inside objects and can only be manipulated through methods.
* Inheritance - The language allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes.
* Polymorphism - The language supports polymorphism, allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.
* Abstraction - The language supports abstract classes and interfaces, allowing the definition of methods without implementation to be completed by derived classes.
These core concepts define whether a language can be considered truly object-oriented.
